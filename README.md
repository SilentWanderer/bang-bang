# Bang-Bang

This is Team 1885's incubating controls library for the 2018-2019 season.
Nearly all of the code here has been imported from 254's own libraries, and is
mostly untouched save some refactoring, documentation, and convenience functions.

## What did we add?

- Functions independently from WPILib
- Robot "profiles" containing information about the robot's dynamics. These can be created at-will.
- Basic kinematic simulation
- Cleaner codebase

## What will we add?

- Separate controller classes
- Modular path/trajectory controllers
- A posture stabilization controller
- Some more drive characterization code
- Streamlined documentation
